<pre class="about">
Thank you for visiting Jest Notes.

This app is designed for stand-up comics to better organize their jokes and view their sets right on the phone on the night of their performance.

With its intergration with a web application, you can write out your jokes online on your browser, and then use your phone to read the jokes and organize them into sets later when you need them.

Since the mobile app automatically maintains your data locally on the phone, you don't need online connection to use this app on your device. No more trying to connect to your email in a basement without data connection on the night of your performance!

You can reorder your jokes on your set, score your jokes, and do a whole lot more!

Instructions

1) Sign up using either iOS or here on this web application
2) Write out your jokes that you want to save. It's easier through this web app, but you can do so on device too. 
3) Organize them into sets on your device (*currently, it's not possible to interact with Sets through this web app although it's in future plans)
4) Whatever joke you write here on the web, it will be synced and reflected on your device. And whatever joke you write on the device, you will be able to see and edit them here on the web. Neat huh!?
5) That's it! Have fun

Troubleshooting

*If you ever happen to delete the app from your mobile device, don't worry about losing any of your data. Your data will be kept here on the web side, and the next time you install and log in, you will redownload the data from the web.

*If you ever have problems syncing correct jokes between mobile and web, you can actually reset your mobile data by deleting the app from your mobile device, and reinstalling it again.
