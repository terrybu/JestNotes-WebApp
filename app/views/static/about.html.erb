<pre class="about">
Thank you for visiting Jest Notes.

This app is designed for stand-up comics to better organize their jokes and view their sets right on the phone on the night of their performance.

With its intergration with a web application, you can write out your jokes online on your browser, and then use your phone to read the jokes later when you need them.

Since the app automatically keeps your data locally on the phone, you don't need online connection to use this app. No more trying to connect to your email in a basement without data connection on the night of your performance!

You can reorder your jokes on your set, score your jokes, and do a whole lot more!
