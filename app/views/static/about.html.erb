Thank you for visiting Jest Notes app.
Jest Notes is a hybrid iOS/Web app, meaning that there is an iOS mobile version of the app in the App Store, and a web application counterpart (aka this very website you are seeing in your browser!)

This app is designed for stand-up comics to better organize their jokes and view their sets right on the phone on the night of their performance.

Write out your jokes online on your browser, and then use your phone to read the jokes and organize them into sets later when you need them.

Since the iOS app automatically maintains your data locally on the phone, you don't need online connection to use this app on your device. No more trying to connect to your email in a basement without data connection on the night of your performance!

You can reorder your jokes on your set, score your jokes, and do a whole lot more!

Instructions

1) Sign up using either iOS app or here on this website.
2) Write out your jokes that you want to save. It's easier through this website, but you can write out your jokes on your device too. 
3) Organize them into sets on your device (*currently, it's not possible to edit or create new Sets through this website)
4) Whatever joke you create here on the website, it will be synced and reflected on your device. And whatever joke you write on the device, you will be able to see and edit them here in the website. Neat huh!?
5) That's it! Have fun

Troubleshooting

*If you ever happen to delete the app from your iOS device, don't worry about losing any of your data. Your data will be kept here on the website, and the next time you install and log in, you will redownload the data from the web.

*If you ever have problems syncing correct jokes between iOS and website, try shutting down the app and reopening

*If that doesn't work, try resetting your app by deleting the app from your mobile device, and reinstalling it again.
