LOgs will be very important for you to REMEMBER the quick and easy solutions you are using. Because once you face a problem or have to re-do it, and you forget, you are SOL.
Keep close logs here.

**When you are dealing with these projects where you don't have time to get back in for a month, you forget everything -_-; make sure you make a habit of making logs like this when you are working on something important for a long time 
**Use "guard" instead of "rails s" for more convenient saving. It automatically reboots rails s when you make changes

***Remember this while trying to create new attributes to send to parse.com 
*it seems that if you try to send a params hash with mass assignment and you don't have strong params setting set exactly right, it will silently fail, not sending anything to Parse.com


*****************
MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS TO GET "SCORE" number attribute working
In your jokes_controller create action
@joke.score = joke_params[:score].to_i

P.S. I had params[:score] in here for the longest time, and it wouldn't work because it wasn't in integer.
